# 👋 Hi, I’m Michelle

I design systems, not just screens.

I’m a **Senior Product Designer** working at the intersection of **design systems, platform UX, and engineering**, with a growing focus on **design engineering**. I care about clarity, scale, and making complex things feel boringly usable.

Most of my work lives in enterprise SaaS, where ambiguity is high, constraints are real, and systems either hold or collapse under their own weight. I'm currently working at 📍 **PwC UK**.

## Find me

- Linkedin: [My Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-luo-b9931a12a/)
- Resume: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/162TAFrhQumRsjoQh9Txu0A9ADMoxlio3/view?usp=sharing/)
- Portfolio: _work in progress_

## What I’m known for

- **Design systems that actually ship**
  - Tokens, components, patterns, documentation
  - Shared ownership between design & engineering
  - Less pixel-policing, more alignment

- **Platform thinking**
  - Navigation, information architecture, system boundaries
  - Designing for scale, not demos
  - Reducing cognitive load for real users under real pressure

- **Bridging design and code**
  - Comfortable in Figma *and* VS Code
  - Learning TypeScript, React, and tooling workflows
  - Interested in how design decisions survive contact with production


## How I work

- Slow down to move fast  
- Prefer principles over polish (until polish matters)  
- Ask “what breaks when this scales?” early  
- Bias toward systems, not one-off solutions  
- Care a lot about documentation and shared language  

I’m not loud in meetings. I think first, then speak when it counts.


## Currently exploring

- Design engineering as a craft
- Frontend fundamentals (React, TS, tooling)
- Better ways to document intent, not just outcomes
- Building small tools and plugins that remove friction


## Side notes (human stuff)

- ADHD brain → pattern-spotting, systems thinking, deep focus when it clicks
- I like things that are calm, precise, and quietly opinionated
- I enjoy making complexity feel obvious in hindsight


This README is less about credentials and more about how I think. If that resonates, great. Let's grab some boba 🧋
